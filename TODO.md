# Face Recognition Fix - TODO List

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Updated `/recognize-face` API endpoint to handle invalid face encodings
- [x] Added validation for input face encoding format
- [x] Added proper error handling for zero-norm encodings
- [x] Only compare active face registrations
- [x] Skip non-array stored encodings gracefully
- [x] Added debug information and statistics to recognition response
- [x] Updated `StudentController::saveFaceRegistration` to validate face encoding format
- [x] Prevent saving non-array face encodings
- [x] Updated JavaScript to prevent registration when Flask server is unavailable
- [x] Removed fallback encoding that stored invalid data
- [x] Updated Flask encoder to handle both JSON (mobile) and FormData (web) inputs

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test face registration with Flask server running
- [ ] Test face registration when Flask server is down (should fail gracefully)
- [ ] Test face recognition with valid registered faces
- [ ] Test face recognition with invalid/mixed encodings in database
- [ ] Ensure Python Flask server can be started if needed
- [ ] Verify cosine similarity threshold is appropriate (currently 0.35)
- [ ] Test mobile app face recognition: Ensure mobile device can access Flask server at http://192.168.1.18:5000
- [ ] Verify mobile app sends correct JSON format: {"image_base64": "base64string"}

## Testing Commands
- Start Laravel server: `php artisan serve`
- Start Python Flask server: `python python/encoder.py` (if available)
- Test recognition API: Use Postman or curl to POST to `/api/recognize-face`
- Check database: Verify face encodings are arrays in `face_registrations` table
